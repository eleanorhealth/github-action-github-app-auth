## Dependency management

This project uses [pip-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/) for hard-pinning dependencies versions.
Please see its documentation for usage instructions.
In short, `requirements.in` contains the list of direct requirements with occasional version constraints and `requirements.txt` is automatically generated from it by adding recursive tree of dependencies with fixed versions.

To upgrade dependency versions, run `pip-compile --generate-hashes` at the root of the repo.

To add a new dependency without upgrade, add it to `requirements.in` and run `pip-compile  --generate-hashes --no-upgrade`.

For installation always use `.txt` files. For example, command `pip install -Ue . -r requirements.txt` will install this project in development mode, testing requirements and development tools.
Another useful command is `pip-sync requirements.txt`, it uninstalls packages from your virtualenv that aren't listed in the file.
